This plugin check and fix only missed schedule failed future posts scheduled virtual cron job items, and no others, to not waste resources.

This plugin to find and fix all failed future posts stored in the database, using an index table for queries, with the result of obtaining fast queries and a low cpu usage (fast queries and cpu optimization): fully compliant with hyper db table query formatting.

This plugin, in order to reduce the CPU load, and do not use too many resources, repair 10 items in each session, every 10 minutes: the default value of 10 items per session, every 10 minutes, was introduced for compatibility with the default values of WordPress feeds syndication.

This plugin is designed for heavy use of scheduled future posts and rss grabbing, FeedWordPress for example, but also work well with a simple WordPress blog or for use as a cms.

The plugin code was totally rewrited for maximum compatibility with W3 Total Cache and others caching plugins, JetPack and others social publishing plugins, transparency and interference free with others scheduled cron jobs at scale.

This plugin not need others actions from the administrator except activate, deactivate or delete it: is ready to single, network multisite installations, and old WPMU 2.6 to 2.9+ (latest is 2.9.2) multi users and run on shared, dedicated, cloud and vps hosting, with high and low resources.
`
Failed run when a good post goes to future.

When thou go, i shall watch for thee;
When thou absent, i shall reschedule for thee;
When thou think, i shall republish for thee.

Schedule run, but count the cost:
The Posts won, but the Missed is lost!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
reasons why WordPress virtual cron job fails could be due to:

* wp-cron not executed on heavy servers load
* wp-cron rarely executed on unvisited servers
* Plugins and Themes conflict
* WordPress bugs: Missed Schedule is a WordPress Bug!
* DNS issue in the server
* DNS issue in the database
* Server Timezone Misconfiguration
* Database Timezone Misconfiguration
* Using cache plugins that prevent WP-Cron from loading
* Using cache objects that prevent WP-Cron from loading
* And many others reasons

= Who Translate This Plugin? =

= How can i get involved? =
GlotPress translations was not supported from this plugin because:

* Translation link exposes the plugins to pushing malicious url?
* Translation description exposes the plugin to change its original meaning?
* Editors may approve or disapprove according personal rules or motivations?
* Not all GlotPress Editors respect plugin Authors directions?
* The approval process is too long?
* Changing the content of the plugin, makes useless all the previous approval process, returning a translation, which no longer conforms to the original content, with the resulting of forcing the author to limiting what is really important to add in his descriptions and link, on future and actual changes.

= How to translate it? =
Is possible to make translations, with traditional method,
using wp-missed-schedule.pot not included on plugin package,
and available on [assets](https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/wp-missed-schedule/assets/languages/) to reduce the size of
ZIP file being served, and no waste user space/bandwidth.

After, send it to sLaNGjIs Team for approval, and publishing.
Translator Credits was applied, indicated, with the name
of your editor, on readme.txt of this plugin, and also
on related [translations page](http://slangji.wordpress.com/translations/)
= Free plugin version support translations? =
No, free plugin support basic translations: only Pro Version support full translations.
= WPML is supported? =
Sorry, is not supported, in any version, for now.
= The WordPress Missed Scheduled Failed Future Posts Who? =
WordPress comes with its own cron job that allows you to schedule your posts and events, however, in many situations, the wp-cron is not working well and leads to posts missed their publication schedule and/or scheduled events not executed.

To understand why this happen, we need to know that the WP-Cron is not a real cron job. It is in fact a virtual cron that only works when a page is loaded. In short, when a page is requested on the frontend/backend, WordPress will first load WP-Cron, follow by the necessary page to display to your reader. The loaded WP-Cron will then check the database to see if there is any thing that needs to be done.

Publish a bunch of future posts noticed that they wont publish and when time comes to go live they just turn Missed Schedule. Took a look at the Wordpress code and noticed future posts get assigned a cronjob `($unix_time_stamp, publish_future_post, array($post_ID))` [wp_schedule_single_event](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_schedule_single_event) Why dont you just look at the database and publish all posts with future status and date in past? My plugin WP Missed Shcedule looks for posts with a date in the past that still have `post_status=future`. It will take each `post_ID` and publish [wp_publish_post](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_publish_post) it.
= How to Work? =
This plugin will check every 10 minutes, if there are posts that match the problem described. [WPMS_DELAY ,10] To not use too many resources, it fix for 10 items per session [LIMIT 10] one session every 10 minutes. All others failed will be solved in future sessions, until no longer exist. When you activate this plugin, the first 10 Missed Scheduled Future Posts are fixed immediately. All others are fixed the next batch. On some case (rare?) are also fixed live. If you have Missed Scheduled Future Posts after this plugin is activated, is not one error or bug: wait the next checking. If Missed Scheduled Future Posts persist, verify that WordPress installation is clean, or exist conflict with others plugins.

N.B. If have active others plugins with the same functions of WP Missed Schedule this is on conflict and not work. I suggest to delete or deactivate all others, clean related database options table, and use only WP Missed Schedule. In the same way WP Missed Schedule could create conflicts with others plugins with the same functions. In this case, delete or disable it and only used the others.
= Dealing with WordPress Missed Schedule =
If you are scheduling blog posts in WordPress and seeing a Missed Schedule message, its likely caused by an issue with your web server, or it is WordPress that is causing the problem of your blog posts not being posted as scheduled. This is an annoying problem. However, there is a very simple fix that is easy to do. The Missed Schedule problem seems to point to the web server and WordPress. The time/date comparison needs to match in order for your blog posts to get published as scheduled. If you are currently using the WordPress, blogging platform, you can easily fix the issue by modifying the wp-cron.php file which is located in the root folder. You simply open your notepad editor in Windows and search for the following line of code, which is located towards the bottom on the file wp-cron.php file.

This is the code you need to search for: `update_option(doing_cron, 0);`

This is the code you need to replace it with: `//update_option(doing_cron, 0);`

Next step is to save the wp-cron.php file and upload to your web server. However, make sure that you renamed the current wp-cron.php on the web server to wp-cron.php-org, just in case there is an issue, and you need to resort back to the original file. The final step is to schedule another blog post and make sure that it processes correctly and that it gets published according to schedule. To manually run the cron, youll need to type or paste the code below in your browser URL without the brackets yourdomain.com/wp-cron.php. If things are working correctly, it should return a blank screen. Furthermore, this should update the time/date comparison between your web server and WordPress.
= The Missed Schedule Problem =
The way WordPress handles scheduling is that whenever a page is loaded, either from your blog or in your admin control panel, the file wp-cron.php is loaded. At normal, if correctly configured, the server can talk to itself just fine and WordPress scheduling system will works perfectly. Its only when you start doing strange and weird things like not having DNS setup properly or blocking loopback connections then it will cause you problems. It is possible that certain web hosts are not allowing WordPress cron jobs to run but for many that is not the issue as scheduled posting was working before upgrading to WordPress 2.7.

In WordPress 2.7, the cron job design, which is the core of the scheduling engine, is significantly changed as you can from both wp-cron.php and cron.php in /wp-includes/ folder. In WordPress 2.7 wp-cron.php, there are references to local-time and doing_cron option is set to zero. This is not exist in WordPress version 2.6.5. This might be the cause of the problem as its very likely that your web server time is off by a few seconds or minutes from the WordPress official time. And doing_cron argument is set to zero making it absolutely necessary that your web server and WordPress time to match with each others in order for the scheduled post to go through.
= Solutioni #1 =
If you think that your web server settings is the cause of the problem, simply type this URL in your browser without the brackets yourblog.com/wp-cron.php (replace yourblog with your actual domain name) to verify. If you see a blank screen, then your web server settings is ok. You can proceed to solution #2. If you see some error pages, then kindly check with your web hosting technical staff and ask for their help.
= Solution #2 =
This is the solution to fix local-time and doing_cron option in wp-cron.php. If your programming is good enough, you are free to change the code and fix the issue yourselves. Remember to backup your WordPress before applying any change in production.

If youre not familiar with programming, dont worry, there is a simple solution.

1. Download WordPress version 2.6.5 from WordPress repository
1. Extract both wp-cron.php and cron.php file from version 2.6.5
1. Backup your WordPress database
1. Rename both wp-cron.php and cron.php in your web server to another name
1. Upload both wp-cron.php and cron.php extracted from version 2.6.5 to your server
= Conclusion = 
I hope the fix working fine for you. WordPress should really look into this issue seriously and provide a fix or help to resolve the issue faced by many of the bloggers. If WordPress is not able to publish future post at predefined time, it should recheck it periodically for several time, says every 10/15 minutes, and publish the post as soon as possible.

[sLaNGjIs Team not provide support on wordpress.org forum](https://slangji.wordpress.com/support/) because we are not interested in reviews o stars on our plugins and themes!

Dear user of plugins or themes: Missed Schedule is a WordPress Bug!

sLaNGjIs Team has started official adventure on WordPress.org forum since 2007!

Everything was very different from today: the plugins and themes developed by us were much less, and also the users who used it.

The traffic generated by users of the WordPress.org forum has increased exponentially, and in the same way also the requests for assistance have increased exponentially.

In the near future this increase will be even more pronounced, as a result of the great success of WordPress.

By contrast, both the posts and threads definable requests and those definable trash are very difficult to finding and follow: the time necessary for this purpose, now, longer a nightmare that one added value service, real.

The problems of this type of assistance, through that instruments, have been deemed ineffective by more and more developers excellent, while the tools available for this workload considered inadequate to many of them.

Many of these developers have already abandoned this platform of assistance by providing others methods of support.

Our team has tried to respond to all for more long years, and maintained the support forums for plugins and themes developed always clean.

Due to this big limitation of platform, and the result of failing to provide a service that gives us satisfaction, as of today August 15 2014, we abandon the active support of this type of structure, started since July 7 2007, to try to give one type of personalized service, targeted to the requests of real user utilization and totally Free of Charge:

1. Bugs [sLaNGjI's GitHub](https://github.com/sLaNGjI/)
1. Suggestions [sLaNGjI's Contact](http://slangjis.org/contact/)
1. Support [sLaNGjI's Premium](https://slangji.wordpress.com/support/premium/)

* Please note that:
 * We are not interested in reviews.
 * Do not write anything like that!
 * We are not interested in stars.
 * Do not make any in that sections!

Possibility that some of us then reply or write on it, will be very low!
